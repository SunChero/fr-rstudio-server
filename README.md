RStudio is a popular IDE these days and most R developpers are pretty familiar with the tool
the software sadly has no support for other language and has no plan to support it antime soon.

this is an easy/hacky way to automatically translate the interface from english to french using script injection
 more intruction will follow...
 
my work environment required the tools to support english and french language for it to be taken seriously ...
obviously if the official package support other language 

this repo contains the www subfolder of RStudio installation
